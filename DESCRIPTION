Description: Multifactor nonparametric analysis of variance based on ranks.
    Builds on the Kruskal-Wallis H test and its 2x2 Scheirer-Ray-Hare
    extension to handle any factorial designs. Provides effect sizes,
    Dunn-Bonferroni pairwise-comparison matrices, and simple-effects
    analyses. Tailored for psychology and the social sciences, with
    beginner-friendly R syntax and outputs that can be dropped into
    journal reports. Includes helpers to export tab-separated results and
    compact tables of descriptive statistics (to APA-style reports).
